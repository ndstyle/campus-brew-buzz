OBJECTIVE: Fix the Find Coffee map page to match the exact design shown in the attached screenshots with proper mobile layout and marker interaction.

CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX:

Map Layout & Sizing:

Remove full-screen map styling
Make map container mobile-first with proper aspect ratio (similar to other pages like feed)
Map should be vertical/portrait oriented, not filling entire screen
Add proper mobile padding and margins consistent with other app pages
Remove Unnecessary Header:

Completely remove the top header section ("find coffee" + menu button)
Map should start immediately below the status bar area
Fix Marker Click Functionality:

Currently markers don't trigger any action when clicked
Clicking a marker MUST open the CafeDetailCard modal (shown in screenshots)
The card should slide up from bottom with cafe information, tags, scores, photos
Ensure the modal has proper mobile positioning and doesn't cover bottom navigation
SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

File: client/src/components/MapPage.tsx

Remove the header div entirely (lines with "find coffee" title and Menu button)
Update map container styling to be mobile-friendly
Ensure marker clicks properly trigger handleCafeClick which opens the CafeDetailCard
Fix any z-index or positioning issues preventing marker interaction
File: client/src/components/CafeMap.tsx

Verify marker click events are properly attached and not being blocked
Ensure markers are interactive and visible
Update map container sizing to work in mobile layout (not full screen)
File: client/src/components/CafeDetailCard.tsx

Verify modal positioning works correctly when triggered from map markers
Ensure it slides up from bottom like in the screenshots
Make sure it doesn't cover the bottom navigation
DESIGN REFERENCE:
The attached screenshots show:

A mobile-sized map view with multiple black markers
When marker is clicked, a detailed card slides up showing cafe info, tags, scores, and photos
No header above the map - it starts right at the top
Clean mobile-first layout with bottom navigation always visible
TESTING CRITERIA:

Map displays in mobile format (not full screen)
No header above map
Clicking any marker opens the cafe detail card
Card shows cafe information and doesn't cover bottom nav
Layout matches the provided screenshots exactly

COMPREHENSIVE PROMPT FOR REPLIT AGENT:

CRITICAL PRIORITY 1: Fix Marker Click Functionality
The map markers are not properly opening the cafe detail cards when clicked. Looking at the console logs, cafes are loading successfully (52 total), but marker clicks aren't triggering the modal. Please debug and fix:

In client/src/components/CafeMap.tsx: Verify the marker click event handlers are properly bound and calling onCafeClick
In client/src/components/MapPage.tsx: Ensure handleCafeClick is correctly setting selectedCafe state
Check that the CafeDetailCard modal is properly rendered when selectedCafe is not null
Add console logging to debug the click event flow if needed
Ensure marker click events aren't being blocked by map interactions or z-index issues
PRIORITY 2: Update CafeDetailCard Component
Once marker clicks work, update client/src/components/CafeDetailCard.tsx:

Remove tags section entirely - Delete the div with "casual dinner", "date night", "outdoor seating", "lunch" tags

Add cafe photos carousel:

Insert after cafe name/address, before action buttons
Horizontal scrollable carousel with 3+ coffee shop exterior/interior photos
Rectangular photos (not square), mobile-optimized
Swipeable horizontally with clickable photos for larger view
Use Unsplash coffee shop URLs like: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1495474472287-4d71bcdd2085?w=400&h=300&fit=crop
Match existing design patterns
Update action buttons:

Remove "reserve" button (Calendar icon) completely
Keep "website" (Globe) and "call" (Phone) buttons
Add "navigate" button with Navigation icon from lucide-react
Navigate button opens: https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&destination=${cafe.latitude},${cafe.longitude}
Maintain 3-column grid layout
PRIORITY 3: Fix Map Layout & Remove Header
Update the map page layout in client/src/components/MapPage.tsx:

Remove the entire header div with "find coffee" title and Menu button
Map should start immediately below status bar area
Update map container styling to be mobile-friendly (not full screen)
Add proper mobile padding/margins consistent with other app pages
Map should be portrait-oriented, not filling entire screen
In client/src/components/CafeMap.tsx:

Update map container sizing for mobile layout instead of full screen
Ensure proper aspect ratio similar to other app pages
Verify modal positioning works correctly and slides up from bottom
Ensure modal doesn't cover bottom navigation
KEEP UNCHANGED:

Header with mini map in detail card
Close button functionality
Scores section (rec score and friend score)
Popular dishes section with food photos
Modal positioning and animations
Any other existing functionality
TESTING REQUIREMENTS:

Verify marker clicks open cafe detail cards
Test modal slides up properly from bottom
Confirm photos carousel works and is swipeable
Test navigate button opens Google Maps with correct coordinates
Ensure mobile layout works without full-screen map
Verify bottom navigation remains accessible
Import any needed icons from lucide-react and maintain consistent mobile-first design patterns throughout.

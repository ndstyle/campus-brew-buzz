ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK - REPORT ON EACH:
A. IMPLEMENTATION STATUS
For each feature above, classify as:

✅ Fully Implemented - Feature complete and tested

🟡 Partially Implemented - Started but needs completion

❌ Missing - Not implemented at all

🐛 Buggy - Implemented but has issues

B. CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT
TypeScript Coverage - Are components properly typed?

Error Handling - Are edge cases handled gracefully?

Performance - Any unnecessary re-renders or API calls?

Security - Are RLS policies and auth checks in place?

Mobile Optimization - Does it work well on mobile devices?

C. USER FLOW VALIDATION
Test and report on these critical user journeys:

New User Signup → Email verification → Profile setup → First review

Cafe Discovery → Map exploration → Cafe details → Review submission

Social Engagement → Feed browsing → Following users → Leaderboard viewing

Review Management → Creating reviews → Viewing own reviews → Editing reviews

D. LAUNCH READINESS CHECKLIST
Can users actually sign up and create accounts?

Can users submit reviews that persist in the database?

Do reviews appear in the feed for other users?

Does the map show real cafe data with working interactions?

Are there any critical bugs that prevent core functionality?

SPECIFIC AREAS TO INVESTIGATE:
🔍 Check These Files/Components:

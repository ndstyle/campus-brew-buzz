# API Documentation â€“ Rateurcoffee

## Overview

This API powers the core functionality of the Rateurcoffee mobile app, focused on review-based discovery of local cafes. It is designed with a Beli-like UX: no visible latitude/longitude data is exposed to the client. Instead, the experience is fully driven through Google Places `place_id`s and metadata.

All endpoints follow RESTful conventions. Auth is JWT-based.

## Notes on Map Integration

- The client uses Google Places API SDK for map display and place details.
- All map-related lookups use place_id as the unique key.
- No lat/lng coordinates are returned by the API; map pins and geolocation are handled client-side via Google Places.
- When user adds a new coffee shop manually, backend stores it with no Google place_id and flags for moderation.
- Location-based filtering is done by campus name and pre-defined campus areas.

This API design keeps user experience aligned with Beli-style flow: hiding raw geo data, relying on Google Places place_ids, and focusing on social discovery via ratings and friends.
